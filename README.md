This is a simple web-based tool to estimate braking distance for motorcycles based on speed and braking system type.

## 🔧 What It Does

Enter your speed and select your bike's brake system (like dual-channel ABS, disc, or drum brakes), and it will calculate an estimated braking distance using physics-based formulas.

You can also:
- Manually enter the coefficient of friction (μ) for advanced calculations
- View the pros and limitations of this tool

## 💡 Why I Built This

As a motorcycle braking software engineer, I built this as an educational project to help riders better understand how braking distance varies with braking technology and riding speed.

It's intended for public awareness and self-learning.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Instant distance calculation using basic physics:  
  `distance = v² / (2 × μ × g)`
- Manual mode for custom friction values
- Simple and clean user interface
- No backend or data collection — 100% frontend

## 📦 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser
3. Or deploy using GitHub Pages for hosting

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Assumes dry, flat road and ideal conditions
- Does not include reaction time
- μ values are estimated for educational purposes
